        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around **objects** rather than functions or logic. These objects are instances of **classes**, which are blueprints or templates that define the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods or functions) of the objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the key principles of OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation**: This refers to bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. Encapsulation also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which helps prevent unintended interference and misuse of the data. This is usually done by defining **public** and **private** access modifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Abstraction**: Abstraction allows you to hide complex implementation details and show only the necessary features of an object. It simplifies interaction with objects by exposing only relevant methods or data to the user or programmer, making the system easier to work with.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inheritance**: This is a mechanism by which one class can inherit properties and methods from another class. Inheritance allows for code reusability and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. A subclass (or derived class) can extend a superclass (or base class) by adding new methods or overriding existing ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism means \"many shapes\" and refers to the ability to treat objects of different types in a uniform way. It allows the same method to behave differently depending on the object it is acting on. There are two types of polymorphism:\n",
        "   - **Compile-time polymorphism** (method overloading)\n",
        "   - **Run-time polymorphism** (method overriding)\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP is widely used in modern programming languages like Java, Python, C++, and C#, and helps in designing systems that are modular, reusable, and easier to maintain."

        "\n",
        "  - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a **class** is essentially a blueprint or template for creating objects (instances). It defines the **attributes** (properties) and **methods** (behaviors or functions) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",

        "1. **Attributes (or properties)**: These are the characteristics or data that objects of the class will have. For example, in a class `Car`, attributes might include `color`, `model`, `year`, and `engine_type`.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Methods (or functions)**: These define the behaviors or actions that objects of the class can perform. For example, in a `Car` class, methods might include `start()`, `accelerate()`, and `brake()`.\n",

        "3. **Constructor**: A special method used to initialize the attributes of an object when it is created. In many languages, this is often called a **constructor** or **initializer** method. For example, in Python, the constructor is `__init__()`.\n",

        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Great question! While **abstraction** and **encapsulation** are both key concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), they have different purposes and work in different ways. Here’s how they differ:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Abstraction**\n",
        "Abstraction is the process of **hiding the complex implementation details** and exposing only the essential features or behaviors to the outside world. It allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Goal**: To simplify the interaction with complex systems by exposing only the necessary details and hiding unnecessary complexity.\n",
        "- **How it works**: It involves defining **abstract classes** or **interfaces** that specify what operations can be done, without providing details on how these operations are implemented. This allows programmers to use objects without needing to know the inner workings.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "Think of a **TV remote**: the **buttons** on the remote are an abstraction. You don’t need to know the underlying code that controls the TV, you just press buttons like \"Power\" or \"Volume Up\". The mechanism of how the button press translates to action on the TV is hidden (abstracted away).\n",
        "\n",
        "In OOP:\n",
        "- An abstract class might provide method signatures (like `turn_on()`), but the actual implementation is left to the subclasses to define.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Encapsulation**\n",
        "Encapsulation is the concept of **bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data** into a single unit, known as a class. It also involves **restricting direct access** to some of an object’s components (usually using access modifiers), to protect the object's integrity and prevent unintended interference.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Goal**: To hide an object's internal state and only allow modification through specific methods, thereby controlling how the data is accessed or updated. This helps safeguard data and makes objects easier to maintain and debug.\n",
        "- **How it works**: It uses **private** and **public** access modifiers to control what can and cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. Access to the internal data is provided via **getter** and **setter** methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "In a **BankAccount** class, you may want to ensure that a user cannot directly change their balance. Instead, you can provide methods like `deposit()` and `withdraw()` to safely modify the balance.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class BankAccount:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, balance):\n",
        "        self.__balance = balance  # private attribute\n",
        "    \n",
        "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
        "        if amount > 0:\n",
        "            self.__balance += amount\n",
        "    \n",
        "    def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
        "        if amount <= self.__balance:\n",
        "            self.__balance -= amount\n",
        "\n",
        "    def get_balance(self):\n",
        "        return self.__balance  # getter method\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example:\n",
        "- **Encapsulation** is shown by the private attribute `__balance` and the use of methods to safely interact with it.\n",
        "- The internal state (`__balance`) cannot be directly accessed from outside the class, which protects it from accidental changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Differences:\n",

        "\n",
        "  - In Python, **dunder methods** (short for \"double underscore\" methods) are special methods that have double underscores (`__`) at the beginning and end of their names.

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **`__len__(self)`**: Defines the behavior for the `len()` function, allowing you to specify the length of an object.\n",

        "- `__getitem__(self, key)` – Defines behavior for indexing (e.g., `obj[key]`).\n",
        "- `__setitem__(self, key, value)` – Defines behavior for assigning to an index (e.g., `obj[key] = value`).\n",

        "\n",
        "### Why Use Dunder Methods?\n",
        "Dunder methods allow you to **customize the behavior** of your objects in a way that integrates seamlessly with Python’s built-in features. By overriding these methods, you can make your objects behave like native Python objects and interact with Python’s syntax and operators in a more natural way.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, overriding `__add__` allows you to define how the `+` operator works for objects of your custom class, while overriding `__str__` lets you control how the object is displayed when printed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### In summary:\n",

        "\n",
        "  - **Inheritance** is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and it allows one class (the **child class** or **subclass**) to **inherit** properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (the **parent class** or **superclass**). This concept allows for **code reuse** and the creation of a **hierarchical relationship** between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why is Inheritance Useful?\n",
        "1. **Code Reusability**: Inheritance allows you to reuse code from a parent class without having to rewrite it in the child class.\n",
        "2. **Extensibility**: You can extend the behavior of a parent class in the child class, adding or modifying methods and attributes to suit your needs.\n",
        "3. **Organization**: It helps organize your classes in a hierarchical way, making your code more modular and easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Terms:\n",
        "- **Parent Class (Superclass)**: The class whose properties and methods are inherited by another class.\n",
        "- **Child Class (Subclass)**: The class that inherits from the parent class. It can access and override the properties and methods of the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Does Inheritance Work?\n",
        "- The **child class** inherits all the non-private attributes and methods from the **parent class**.\n",
        "- The **child class** can **override** methods from the **parent class** to change or extend their behavior.\n",
        "- The **child class** can also have its own unique methods and attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Basic Example of Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Parent Class\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "    \n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(f\"{self.name} makes a sound.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Child Class\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
        "        # Calling the parent class's constructor\n",
        "        super().__init__(name)\n",
        "        self.breed = breed\n",

        "dog.speak()     # Output: Rex barks.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Breakdown of the Example:\n",
        "1. **Animal** is the **parent class** that defines the `speak()` method.\n",
        "2. **Dog** is the **child class** that inherits from **Animal**. It overrides the `speak()` method to provide its own behavior.\n",
        "3. The `super()` function is used in the **child class constructor** (`__init__`) to call the constructor of the **parent class** (`Animal`), ensuring that the `name` attribute is properly initialized.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Types of Inheritance:\n",
        "1. **Single Inheritance**: A class inherits from one parent class.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "       pass\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Multiple Inheritance**: A class inherits from more than one parent class.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Animal:\n",
        "       pass\n",

        "       pass\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A class inherits from a class that is already a subclass of another class.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Animal:\n",
        "       pass\n",

        "   class Mammal(Animal):\n",

        "       pass\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple classes inherit from a single parent class.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Animal:\n",
        "       pass\n",

        "       pass\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of more than one type of inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points About Inheritance:\n",
        "- **Method Overriding**: A child class can **override** methods of the parent class to change their behavior. The method in the child class has the same name as the one in the parent class, but can implement different logic.\n",
        "- **Accessing Parent Methods**: Even if a child class overrides a method, it can still call the parent class's version of the method using `super()`.\n",
        "- **Constructor Inheritance**: When you create an object of the child class, it automatically calls the constructor of the parent class (if it's not overridden in the child). You can call the parent constructor explicitly using `super()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example with `super()`:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "    \n",

        "dog.speak()  # Output: Buddy barks.\n",
        "```\n",

        "### In Summary:\n",
        "- **Inheritance** allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class).\n",

        "  - **Polymorphism** is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and it refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method or operation in **different ways**. The word *polymorphism* comes from Greek, meaning \"many shapes\" – it allows a single interface to represent different underlying forms or behaviors.\n",

        "1. **Compile-time polymorphism (Static polymorphism)**:\n",

        "\n",
        "  - **Encapsulation** is one of the key principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and it is achieved in Python through the practice of **bundling** data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (a class). Additionally, it involves controlling the access to certain components of an object to protect its internal state from unintended or harmful modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, encapsulation is implemented using **access modifiers** (like **public**, **protected**, and **private**) and the use of **getter and setter methods**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts of Encapsulation in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Private Attributes**: These are variables that are not meant to be accessed directly from outside the class. Python doesn't have strict access control like other languages (e.g., Java or C++), but it uses a convention to indicate that an attribute is private by prefixing it with double underscores (`__`).\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Getter and Setter Methods**: These methods allow controlled access to private or protected attributes. The getter method retrieves the value of the attribute, while the setter method updates the value of the attribute, often with validation or checks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Private Attributes**:\n",
        "In Python, attributes that are prefixed with `__` are treated as private. While they are still accessible in some ways, Python makes them less directly accessible by name-mangling (changing the name of the attribute behind the scenes).\n",
        "\n",

        "- The `__name` and `__age` attributes are **private**, which means they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
        "- Instead, we use **getter** and **setter** methods (`get_name()`, `get_age()`, `set_name()`, `set_age()`) to interact with these private attributes.\n",
        "- If you attempt to directly access `person.__name`, Python will throw an `AttributeError` because it's name-mangled to something like `person._Person__name`, making it harder (but not impossible) to access directly.\n",
        "  \n",
        "### 2. **Protected Attributes**:\n",
        "In Python, there is a convention to indicate that an attribute or method should be considered \"protected\" by using a **single underscore** (`_`). This is more of a guideline to tell other developers that this attribute should not be accessed directly, but it does not provide true access control.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example of Protected Attributes:\n",
        "```python\n",

        "print(dog._name)  # Accessing protected attribute (possible, but discouraged)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Explanation:\n",
        "- The `_name` and `_breed` attributes are **protected**, and the convention is that they should **not** be accessed directly outside the class or subclass.\n",
        "- However, this is just a convention, and Python does not strictly prevent access to protected attributes (as seen when `dog._name` is accessed directly).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Encapsulation Using Property Decorators (Getters and Setters)**:\n",
        "Python also allows you to use **property decorators** to define getter and setter methods in a cleaner and more Pythonic way. The `@property` decorator allows you to define a method as a \"getter\" for an attribute, and the `@<attribute>.setter` decorator lets you define a setter for it.\n",

        "\n",
        "  - In Python, a **constructor** is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. Its primary purpose is to **initialize** the attributes of the new object. The constructor method is always named `__init__()`, and it is a part of Python’s object-oriented system.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points about Constructors:\n",
        "1. **Name**: The constructor method in Python is always named `__init__(self)`.\n",
        "2. **Automatic Invocation**: It is automatically invoked when a new object is instantiated.\n",
        "3. **Self Parameter**: The constructor takes at least one argument, `self`, which refers to the instance of the class being created. It allows the constructor to set the instance’s attributes.\n",
        "4. **Initialization**: Inside the constructor, you can initialize the attributes of the object using the `self` keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Syntax of a Constructor:\n",

This is a concept commonly found in statically typed languages like Java or C++, but Python does not support traditional method overloading in the same way. In Python, you cannot define multiple methods with the same name but different signatures. Instead, Python supports **dynamic typing**, which means you can define a method that can accept a variable number of arguments and handle them differently based on the input.\n",

        "While Python does not allow traditional method overloading, it can still achieve similar behavior using techniques like:\n",

        "14 .Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Polymorphism is one of the fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and it plays a critical role in making your code more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, often leading to cleaner and more modular designs. Here's why polymorphism is so important:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Code Reusability**\n",
        "   Polymorphism allows you to write more generic and reusable code. For example, a function can be written to accept objects of different classes that share the same superclass or interface, making it adaptable to new types of objects without modifying the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Example:** A method can accept any object that implements a common interface or inherits from a common class. This allows you to reuse the method for various types of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Extensibility**\n",
        "   With polymorphism, new classes can be added to a system without changing the existing codebase. You can extend a class or implement an interface and define your own version of a method without affecting other classes that also use the same method. This is especially useful when the code is part of a larger system or framework.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Example:** If you have a base class with a method, you can override that method in subclasses to provide specific implementations, and new subclasses can be added without altering the existing functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Simplifies Code Maintenance**\n",
        "   Polymorphism promotes a clean, consistent interface. Since you can treat objects of different types uniformly (through common interfaces or base classes), the code becomes easier to read and maintain. When you add new functionality or need to fix bugs, changes are often localized to the relevant subclass, avoiding widespread changes across the codebase.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Decoupling and Flexibility**\n",
        "   Polymorphism reduces the coupling between components. You can write code that works with different types of objects without needing to know the specifics of each one. This decoupling makes the system more flexible and less dependent on concrete implementations, allowing for easier modifications and extensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Example:** You might have a function that works with shapes, but it doesn't care whether the shape is a `Circle`, `Rectangle`, or `Triangle`. It just uses polymorphism to invoke a method like `draw()`, and the specific implementation depends on the actual object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Runtime Flexibility (Dynamic Polymorphism)**\n",
        "   Polymorphism also allows for dynamic method binding (runtime polymorphism), where the method that gets executed is determined at runtime based on the object type. This makes your code more flexible and enables behavior changes without altering the code structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Example:** In method overriding (a form of polymorphism), the type of object at runtime determines which version of a method is called, even if the method is invoked through a reference to the superclass.\n",
        "\n",

        "```java\n",

        "\n",
        "  - In Python, an **abstract class** is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It is designed to be subclassed, and its main purpose is to provide a common interface and shared behavior for its subclasses while leaving certain methods or behaviors unimplemented. These methods are called **abstract methods**, and they must be implemented by any non-abstract subclass.\n",

        "\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages that make it a popular paradigm for software development. Here are some key benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Modularity**: OOP allows you to break down complex systems into smaller, manageable modules (objects). This makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and test.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reusability**: Once a class is created, it can be reused across different parts of the program or in different projects. This helps save development time and effort.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Encapsulation**: OOP allows you to bundle data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit or class. This helps in hiding the internal details (implementation) of an object, exposing only what's necessary (public interface). This makes the system more secure and easier to manage.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Inheritance**: OOP enables a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, which promotes code reuse and helps in creating hierarchical relationships between objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Polymorphism**: With polymorphism, you can define methods in a way that allows them to take different forms. This increases flexibility and allows for methods to work with different types of objects in a more generalized way.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Maintainability**: Since OOP encourages modularity and separation of concerns, it's generally easier to maintain and update code. Changes made to one part of the code don’t necessarily affect other parts of the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Scalability**: OOP systems tend to scale more easily because new features or functionality can be added by creating new classes and objects without affecting the existing structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Easier debugging and testing**: Because of the encapsulation and modular structure, it’s easier to test and debug individual components or classes, which leads to more efficient troubleshooting.\n",

        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Multiple inheritance** in Python refers to the ability of a class to inherit from more than one parent class. This allows a derived class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from multiple base classes (parent classes), giving the derived class access to the functionality of all its parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points:\n",
        "1. **Multiple Parent Classes**: A child class can inherit from more than one class, which means it can have more than one direct parent. Each parent class can contribute its own attributes and methods to the child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**: Python uses an algorithm called the **C3 linearization** (or MRO) to determine the order in which methods are inherited from multiple base classes. The MRO ensures that there is no ambiguity in which method is called when it exists in multiple parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Super() Function**: In multiple inheritance, `super()` is often used to call methods from parent classes in the correct order according to the MRO.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Syntax:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Parent1:\n",
        "    def method1(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Method of Parent1\")\n",

        "\n",
        "### Method Resolution Order (MRO):\n",
        "When a method is called on an object, Python looks for that method in the class hierarchy. If it's not found in the class itself, Python moves up the class chain to look for it in the parent classes in a specific order. You can view the MRO using the `mro()` method or `__mro__` attribute of the class.\n",

        "Example:\n",

        "### Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
        "- **Code Reusability**: It allows classes to inherit functionality from more than one parent class, making it possible to reuse code from multiple sources.\n",
        "- **Flexibility**: Multiple inheritance provides greater flexibility in designing a class, as it can combine features from different parent classes.\n",
        "  \n",

        "- **Complexity**: If not handled carefully, multiple inheritance can make the class hierarchy complex and harder to maintain.\n",
        "- **Ambiguity**: If different parent classes have methods with the same name, it can create ambiguity about which method should be called, although Python resolves this via MRO.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example with ambiguity:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class A:\n",

        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The `super()` function in Python is a built-in function used to call methods from a parent class (superclass) from within a subclass. It plays a crucial role in inheritance, allowing you to access the methods and attributes of the parent class in a way that avoids directly referencing the parent class by name. This is particularly useful in cases of **method overriding** and **multiple inheritance**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Uses and Significance of `super()`:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Accessing Methods of Parent Classes**:\n",
        "   - When you override a method in a subclass, you can still call the method of the parent class using `super()`. This allows you to extend or modify the behavior of inherited methods without completely replacing them.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Animal:\n",
        "       def speak(self):\n",
        "           print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",

        "       def speak(self):\n",
        "           super().speak()  # Calls the speak method from Animal class\n",
        "           print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "   dog = Dog()\n",
        "   dog.speak()\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   \n",
        "   **Output:**\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   Animal speaks\n",
        "   Dog barks\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   In this example, `super().speak()` calls the `speak()` method from the `Animal` class before executing the `print(\"Dog barks\")` statement in the `Dog` class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Ensuring Correct Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Multiple Inheritance**:\n",
        "   - In cases of **multiple inheritance**, `super()` ensures that methods from the parent classes are called in a consistent and well-defined order. Python uses the **C3 Linearization** algorithm to determine the Method Resolution Order (MRO) and `super()` follows that order.\n",
        "   \n",

        "\n",
        "   class B:\n",
        "       def hello(self):\n",
        "           print(\"Hello from B\")\n",
        "\n",
        "   class C(A, B):\n",
        "       def hello(self):\n",
        "           super().hello()  # Calls hello() from class A first (due to MRO)\n",
        "           print(\"Hello from C\")\n",
        "\n",
        "   c = C()\n",
        "   c.hello()\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   \n",
        "   **Output:**\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   Hello from A\n",
        "   Hello from C\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   In this example, `super().hello()` first calls the `hello()` method from class `A`, because `A` comes before `B` in the MRO of class `C`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Calling the Parent Class Constructor (`__init__`)**:\n",
        "   - A common use of `super()` is in calling the constructor (`__init__`) of a parent class to initialize its attributes. This allows the child class to inherit and extend the initialization logic without completely overriding the parent class's constructor.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Animal:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "           self.name = name\n",
        "\n",
        "   class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "       def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
        "           super().__init__(name)  # Calls the constructor of the Animal class\n",
        "           self.breed = breed\n",
        "\n",
        "   dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Golden Retriever\")\n",

        "   print(dog.breed)  # Output: Golden Retriever\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   Here, `super().__init__(name)` calls the `__init__()` method from the `Animal` class, allowing the `Dog` class to initialize both the `name` (inherited from `Animal`) and `breed` (specific to `Dog`).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Avoiding Explicit Parent Class Name**:\n",
        "   - By using `super()`, you avoid the need to explicitly refer to the parent class. This is particularly useful in cases where you have multiple levels of inheritance and want to avoid hardcoding the class name, making your code more maintainable and flexible.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class A:\n",

        "\n",
        "### Benefits of Using `super()`:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Avoids Code Duplication**: By calling parent class methods using `super()`, you can reuse the code of the parent class instead of rewriting similar code in the subclass.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Flexible Inheritance**: With `super()`, you can work with multiple inheritance more easily, as it respects the MRO (Method Resolution Order) and ensures that methods from multiple parent classes are called in the correct order.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Extending Behavior**: `super()` allows you to extend the functionality of parent class methods instead of completely replacing them. This is useful for customizing behavior without losing the base functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Maintaining Consistency**: In complex class hierarchies, `super()` ensures that every class in the hierarchy is correctly initialized and that methods are called in the proper order, preventing errors and inconsistencies.\n",

        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The `__del__` method in Python is a special method known as a **destructor**. It is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage-collected, which typically happens when there are no more references to the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points about `__del__`:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Purpose**: The `__del__` method is used to define cleanup behavior for an object before it is destroyed. This can include:\n",
        "   - Releasing external resources like file handles, database connections, or network sockets.\n",
        "   - Performing any final cleanup tasks, like saving state or releasing memory that isn’t automatically handled by Python’s garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **When is `__del__` Called?**:\n",
        "   - `__del__` is automatically called when the object's reference count drops to zero, meaning there are no more references to the object.\n",
        "   - This happens when the object is about to be garbage-collected, although the exact timing is controlled by Python’s garbage collection mechanism (which is non-deterministic).\n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **Limitations**:\n",
        "   - The exact moment when `__del__` is called is not guaranteed. Since it is tied to garbage collection, there can be a delay in calling the `__del__` method.\n",
        "   - You cannot reliably control the order in which objects are destructed in a program, especially when dealing with circular references (where objects reference each other). Python's garbage collector handles that separately.\n",
        "   - If your object is part of a circular reference (e.g., two objects referencing each other), `__del__` may not be called unless the garbage collector explicitly cleans up the circular reference.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Not Always Recommended**:\n",
        "   - In many cases, explicit resource management is better handled using context managers (`with` statement) or explicit resource release methods (like `close()` for file handles) instead of relying on `__del__`.\n",
        "   - Relying too much on `__del__` can make your code difficult to reason about, especially due to the non-deterministic nature of when it is called.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of `__del__`:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### Important Considerations:\n",
        "- **Resource Management**: For managing external resources (like files or network connections), it's better to use **context managers** with the `with` statement instead of relying on `__del__`. This is because the `with` statement guarantees the proper cleanup of resources as soon as the block is exited, whereas `__del__` may not be called immediately.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Example using a context manager:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  class FileManager:\n",
        "      def __init__(self, filename):\n",

        "  Using the `with` statement ensures that the file is closed immediately after the block is exited, and you don’t have to rely on the non-deterministic `__del__`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Circular References**: If an object is part of a reference cycle (e.g., two objects referring to each other), `__del__` might not be called automatically, as Python’s garbage collector might not collect the objects immediately.

        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Polymorphism in Python refers to the ability of different classes to provide different implementations of a method that is defined in a common interface (usually a parent class). With polymorphism, one interface can be used to represent different types of objects, and the specific method that gets called depends on the type of the object at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Polymorphism Works with Inheritance in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, polymorphism works through **method overriding** and **dynamic dispatch** (method resolution at runtime). It allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. When a method is called on an object, Python determines which version of the method to call based on the actual class of the object (not the type of reference or the type of the variable).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts in Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Method Overriding**: A subclass can override a method of its parent class to provide a specific implementation. Even though the method is called on an instance of the subclass, the subclass's implementation will be executed, not the parent class's.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dynamic Method Resolution**: When you invoke a method on an object, Python looks for that method in the class of the object (not the type of the reference). If the method is not found in the subclass, it searches up the class hierarchy to the parent class (and so on up the chain).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of Polymorphism in Python with Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's demonstrate polymorphism with an example where we define a common method `speak()` in a base class `Animal` and override it in multiple subclasses (`Dog`, `Cat`).\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal makes a sound\")\n",

        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Cat meows\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Polymorphism in action\n",
        "def animal_sound(animal):\n",

        "animal_sound(dog)  # Output: Dog barks\n",
        "animal_sound(cat)  # Output: Cat meows\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### How it Works:\n",
        "- The `animal_sound` function accepts an `animal` object and calls `animal.speak()`.\n",
        "- Despite the fact that the `animal_sound` function is written to call `speak()` on any `Animal` object, the actual method that gets called depends on the type of the object passed to it (either `Dog` or `Cat`).\n",
        "- This is an example of **runtime polymorphism** (also called **method overriding**), where the appropriate method is selected based on the actual type of the object, not the reference type.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Advantages of Polymorphism in Python:\n",

        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Method chaining** in Python refers to the practice of calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line of code. This is achieved by ensuring that each method in the chain returns the object itself (i.e., `self`), which allows subsequent methods to be called on the same instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Method chaining is a common pattern in object-oriented programming (OOP) because it provides a fluent, readable way to perform multiple operations on an object in one statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Method Chaining Works:\n",
        "For method chaining to work, each method in the chain must return the object (`self`) after performing its action. This allows the next method to be called on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of Method Chaining:\n",

        "```python\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",

        "### Explanation:\n",
        "- The `set_age()` and `set_city()` methods modify the `Person` object and return `self`, which allows the next method (`set_city()` or `display()`) to be called directly on the same object.\n",
        "- The `display()` method prints the information and also returns `self`, which means you could continue chaining if needed, though in this example, we’re done after displaying the information.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Concise Code**: Method chaining allows you to write more concise and readable code, especially when performing a series of operations on the same object.\n",
        "   \n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Decorators**: You can use `__call__` to create callable objects that function as decorators. A decorator is a function that takes another function and extends its behavior, and by using `__call__`, you can make an object behave like a decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Functional Programming Patterns**: If you’re implementing functional programming patterns in Python, `__call__` can allow you to use objects in a functional style, passing them around as if they were functions.\n",

        "### Explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Base Class `House`**:\n",
        "   - The `House` class has a constructor `__init__` that initializes the attributes `address` and `price`. These represent the address and the price of the house.\n",
        "   - The `display_info()` method prints the address and price of the house.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Derived Class `Mansion`**:\n",
        "   - The `Mansion` class inherits from the `House` class. It has an additional attribute `number_of_rooms`, which specifies how many rooms the mansion has.\n",
        "   - The `__init__()` method in `Mansion` calls the constructor of the `House` class using `super().__init__(address, price)` to initialize the inherited attributes `address` and `price`.\n",
        "   - The `display_info()` method in `Mansion` calls the `display_info()` method of the `House` class (using `super().display_info()`) to display the address and price, and then adds the display of the `number_of_rooms`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Creating Instances**:\n",
        "   - We create an instance of `House` and an instance of `Mansion`. The mansion instance has an additional attribute `number_of_rooms`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Displaying Information**:\n",
        "   - We call the `display_info()` method on both the `House` and `Mansion` objects to display their information. The mansion object will display the inherited information (address and price) from the `House` class as well as its own attribute `number_of_rooms`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output:\n",
        "\n",
        "```plaintext\n",
        "House Information:\n",
        "Address: 123 Main St, Springfield\n",
        "Price: $300000\n",
        "\n",
        "Mansion Information:\n",
        "Address: 456 Luxury Blvd, Beverly Hills\n",
        "Price: $5000000\n",
        "Number of Rooms: 10\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Inheritance**: The `Mansion` class inherits from the `House` class, which means it can reuse and extend the functionality of the `House` class.\n",
        "- **`super()`**: The `super()` function is used to call the constructor (`__init__`) and methods from the base class (`House`), allowing the `Mansion` class to initialize the attributes from `House` and extend its functionality.\n",
        "- **Method Overriding**: The `display_info()` method is overridden in the `Mansion` class to add more specific information (`number_of_rooms`), while still calling the base class method to print the common information (`address` and `price`).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "This example demonstrates how to use **inheritance** in Python to create a derived class (`Mansion`) that adds specific attributes (`number_of_rooms`) while reusing and extending the functionality of a base class (`House`)."
